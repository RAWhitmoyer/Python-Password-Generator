# Python Password Generator

This passwords generator creates passwords from randomly selected capital letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and digits. The main function of the program is a loop that generates a random character from each class of the predefined characters. The number of iterations of the generating loop is determined by command line arguments. The standard length password that the program creates is 8 characters which corresponds to no arugments. The argument "-m" corresponds to a medium length password of 12 characters and "-l" corresponds to a long password of 16 characters while "-h" prints a helpful guide. No matter the length of the password, there are the same number of each of the character types in each generated password (ie. the standard has 2 capitals, 2 lowercase, 2 special characters, and 2 digits).
